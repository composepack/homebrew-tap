# homebrew-tap

Homebrew tap for ComposePack. The formula is auto-generated and updated by the composepack/composepack release workflow.

## Install

First time: brew tap composepack/tap
Install: brew install composepack
Upgrade: brew update && brew upgrade composepack
How It Works

On each tagged release in composepack/composepack, CI builds macOS binaries, computes checksums, generates Formula/composepack.rb, and pushes it here.
Formula source: Formula/composepack.rb
Main project: <https://github.com/composepack/composepack>
Troubleshooting

Ensure Homebrew is up to date: brew update
If the tap was added before, you can run: brew tap --repair composepack/tap
Re-tap if needed: brew untap composepack/tap && brew tap composepack/tap
